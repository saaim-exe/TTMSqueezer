// FIX THIS BOOST RANDOM LINKER ERROR 

likely something with old vcpkg webscoketpp 
might need to remove and reinstall and use websockett as header only 

// next task 

-> we need to extract all the data being sent via the exchanges into extracatable data (json convereter pars_json.h)
-> use logic from ttm_calculator.h/cpp to caluclate realtime moving averages, then variance sd.. etc. until finally bollinger band and keltner channels to predict the TTM squeeze 

// ONLY ONCE LOGIC IS WORKING 

-> start wroking on gui 

-> something lightweight and scalable for multiple tickers, also user-friendly and documentable
